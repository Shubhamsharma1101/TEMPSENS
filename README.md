# TEMP102 (Temperature sensor)

A sensor which records the temperature readings of the surroundings.

## PURPOSE
<BR>
  
The sensor will give temperature readings of the objects like battery and circuit board so that we can detect whether it is damaged or  it can still work . Like it can be used to test the temperature for multiple objects in a particular device such as smart phone, laptop. Also for example it can be used to record the temperature readings of the device called  drone .


## COMPONENTS REQUIRED 
<BR>
  
  In order to build this project these are the essential components that you need:

:-Raspberry pi
:-TMP102 ( Temperature Sensor)
:- Jumper wires and breadboard to obtain the i2c address for the sensor on the temporary circuit.
:- PCB board with final circuit printed on it .
:- Header pins to attach raspberry pi and the sensor together on PCB.
:- Case to hold ciruit together and prevent it from damaging.

 
## TOTAL EXPENCE OF THE PROJECT

Here is the budget of my project by opening the link below you can check the total cost of it and by further clicking on the components such as raspberry pi you can check the website from where I bought each part .

## TIME REQUIRED 
By going through all the instructions and following them carefully and properly you can make the project within a time span of two days . ONCE YOU GET ALL THE PARTS YOU REQUIRE FOR THE PROJECT.
  And if you are pursuing other courses in a school then you need to make a proper schedule so that equal time is given on each and everything .
