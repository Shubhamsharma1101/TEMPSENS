# TEMP102 (Temperature sensor)

A sensor which records the temperature readings of the surroundings.

## PURPOSE
<BR>
  
The sensor will give temperature readings of the objects like battery and circuit board so that we can detect whether it is damaged or  it can still work . Like it can be used to test the temperature for multiple objects in a particular device such as smart phone, laptop. Also for example it can be used to record the temperature readings of the device called  drone .


## COMPONENTS REQUIRED 
<BR>
  
  In order to build this project these are the essential components that you need:

:-Raspberry pi
:-TMP102 ( Temperature Sensor)
:- Jumper wires and breadboard to obtain the i2c address for the sensor on the temporary circuit.
:- PCB board with final circuit printed on it .
:- Header pins to attach raspberry pi and the sensor together on PCB.
:- Case to hold ciruit together and prevent it from damaging.
