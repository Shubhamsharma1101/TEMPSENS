PROGRESS REPORT:-
<BR>
So it is week 10 and I got my PCB today from the prototype lab. I was late in getting it because when i went on monday to confirm that wheter my PCB is done but vlad told me that they havn't recieved any email under my name then I showed him the mail I had sent and he replied  that it must be stuck in a spam or something like that and told me to re-send it again. So I got it on tuesday and did my soldering in the class. Once soldering was done so I tried to obtain my i2c address by connecting my PCB to the Raspberry and i was successful in doing it.

So its end of week 9 and i am pretty much done with half of my project .I have designed my pcb i used a 12 header pins because all my pins  that were to be connected were not in single line. So I uploaded two pictures one with the sensor and one with the 12 header pin.
And i have sent my gerber files  to prototype lab so that they can give my designed PCB.

This week i connected all my wires from the sensor to the breadboard and then connected it to my raspberry pi . 
Also you can see in the picture there is my i2c address on the rpi terminal. Before it was showing me address (48)  instead of 4a when i connected all my wires and made  the connection for RPI terminal connection. Then I added one more wire (IN PICTURE WHITE WIRE) i.e address wire which goes from SDA to ADD0.
