## Temperature Sensor

## Week12 

ENCLOSURE

This week was case design due. After I recieved all of my parts from the prototype lab I assembled  them together with my PCB and RASPBERRY PI inside it . I kept my sensor out of the case cause I think it might affect the readings. All my parts are enclosed properly, easily accessible and securely attached.

## Week 11

PCB POWER UP
<BR>
  
 PROGRESS REPORT
  <BR>
  
  
This week was PCB power up Milestone I  already tried to finish up with that during my weekend . For this I had to first learn some PYTHON language as I had never done that before.I searched on google for my code so that I have my readings on my sensor and tried alot of things by watching a  You tube  video as well. I followed all the steps as shown in the video and was able to get the reading .
The reading that i got was in hexadecimal . So I had to convert my hex value to dec I searched for it on google tried different ways to get upon that but  was not able to figure it out.
Finally sparkfun gave me a hope they also had a code for my TMP102 sensor i followed all the steps in class and this was giving me a Remote I/O error so i googled how to get rid of the error and was successful .Then I rubbed my hand and covered the sensor with my fingers and it was showing change in temperature.Also on blowing air from the mouth it shows a change in the readings.

## Week 10 

PCB soldering

![pcb design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43188523/48296731-7f672d00-e468-11e8-8140-c19316ed11c4.jpg)

PROGRESS REPORT:-
<BR>
So it is week 10 and I got my PCB today from the prototype lab. I was late in getting it because when i went on monday to confirm that wheter my PCB is done but vlad told me that they havn't recieved any email under my name then I showed him the mail I had sent and he replied  that it must be stuck in a spam or something like that and told me to re-send it again. So I got it on tuesday and did my soldering in the class.To connect my sensor to PCB I bought header pins for my sensor from the prototype lab. Once soldering was done so I tried to obtain my i2c address by connecting my PCB to the Raspberry and i was successful in doing it. 
  <BR> 
So no additional expense was added in my original budget.

## Week 9:
PCB design

So its end of week 9 and i am pretty much done with half of my project .I have designed my pcb i used a 12 header pins because all my pins  that were to be connected were not in single line. So I uploaded two pictures one with the sensor and one with the 12 header pin.
And i have sent my gerber files  to prototype lab so that they can give my designed PCB.

## Week 8:

This week i connected all my wires from the sensor to the breadboard and then connected it to my raspberry pi . 
Also you can see in the picture there is my i2c address on the rpi terminal. Before it was showing me address (48)  instead of 4a when i connected all my wires and made  the connection for RPI terminal connection. Then I added one more wire (IN PICTURE WHITE WIRE) i.e address wire which goes from SDA to ADD0.
